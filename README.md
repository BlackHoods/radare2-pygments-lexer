This is a rudimentary radare2 output lexer for use with Pygments.  I make use of it with the [pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) static site generator.


Some examples of the current state:

To install type:

```console
$ pip install git+https://github.com/TobalJackson/radare2-pygments-lexer.git
```

It should now appear in the list of lexers generated by typing `pygmentize -L`

To uninstall the package:

```console
$ pip uninstall r2highlight
```
