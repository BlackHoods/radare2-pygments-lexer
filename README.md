This is a rudimentary radare2 output lexer for use with Pygments.  I make use of it with the [pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) static site generator.


Some examples of the current state:

To install type:

```console
$ python setup.py install
```

It should now appear in the list of lexers generated by typing `pygmentize -L`

To remove package:

* Delete the r2highlight `.egg` file in your site-packages directory.
* Remove the r2highlight-0.0.0-pyX.Y.egg line from the easy-install.pth file in your site-packages directory.
